Do you want to move existing files to /app-example instead of deleting them? (Y/n): n


Each platform has its own quirks
- iOS loves its sleek navigation stacks
- Andriod has those material design vibes
- Web is all about custom layouts and URLs

When you have these files and direct your page to go to
    import About from '@/components/about';
and
    components/about.iso.tsx    << default iphone will go to
    components/about.tsx        << default android device will go to
    components/about.web.tsx    << default webpage view will go to.
It's very nice that expo router will directly choose which platform that you are in and forward you to the corresponding component file.


But if you want to detect the platform to do specific things, like choosing different layout, you can see it in the app/_layout.tsx page.
E.g. in web, it will show left side nav and in iso|android devices, it will show <Tabs> view

Platform.OS value:
'ios' | 'web' | 'andriod' | 'macos' | 'windows'
